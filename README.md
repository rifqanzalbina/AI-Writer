Notes:

1). Focus is on writing/generating highly unique, SEO optimized blog content. <br>
2). Models: Openai, gemini, ollama are interesting. Minstral API is also worth exploring. Cohere API is purpose made. <br>
Focus is getting the prompts right. Shit in, shit out, irrespective of dollars and cutting edge models.
Pydantically speakng, Due to experimental nature of prompting, its getting expensive soon enough. Gemini is free for now. <br>
3). Missing frontend: A smart backend will enable a good frontend. WIP, backend. So, frontend; coming soon. <br>
4).Getting AI agents to 'brainstrom' blog ideas seems more pressing. CrewAI seems more straightforward than autogen. <br>
5). Too Many APIs floating around: The implementation is using tools that dont depend on API keys and rather scrape them. <br>
Duh, scraping wont scale, that is GPT vision based scraping will come in handy.
